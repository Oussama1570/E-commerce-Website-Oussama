1. Ensure Tailwind CSS is installed:
Run the following command to make sure that tailwindcss is installed in your project:


npm install tailwindcss@^3.4.10
2. Initialize Tailwind CSS configuration:
Once Tailwind CSS is installed, run the following command to initialize the configuration files (tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js):


npx tailwindcss init -p
This will generate the necessary Tailwind configuration files in your project.

3. Verify the Tailwind CSS configuration:
Ensure that your tailwind.config.js file looks something like this:

js

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Also, ensure that postcss.config.js exists with the following content:

js

import tailwindcss from 'tailwindcss'
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'

export default {
  plugins: [tailwindcss, autoprefixer],
}
4. Check Tailwind CSS setup:
Make sure Tailwind's directives are added to your main CSS file (e.g., src/index.css or src/styles.css):

css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
5. Run the shadcn command again:
After completing the steps above, you should be able to run the shadcn initialization command again:


npx shadcn@latest init
This should now successfully detect the Tailwind CSS configuration and proceed with the setup.
